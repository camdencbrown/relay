# Relay Real-World Data Challenge

## Mission

Test **Relay** (http://localhost:8001) by loading REAL data from public APIs and answering a business question with visualization.

You have ZERO prior knowledge of Relay. Figure it out and deliver insights.

---

## Business Question

**"Which cryptocurrency has the highest market cap, and how does its 24h price change compare to the top 5 competitors?"**

Answer should include:
- Top crypto by market cap
- Price change % for top 5
- Simple bar chart visualization

---

## Your Data Source

**CoinGecko Public API** (no auth required)

**Endpoint:** `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets`

**Parameters:**
```
?vs_currency=usd
&order=market_cap_desc
&per_page=10
&page=1
&sparkline=false
```

**Full URL:**
```
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=10&page=1&sparkline=false
```

This returns the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap with current prices, market caps, and 24h changes.

## Your Task

**Phase 1: Discover Relay** (2 min)
- Figure out what Relay can do
- Understand how to load REST API data

**Phase 2: Load Real Data** (3 min)
- Create a pipeline that pulls from CoinGecko API
- Move data to S3 via Relay
- Verify it loaded successfully

**Phase 3: Query & Analyze** (3 min)
- Query the data to find top crypto by market cap
- Get 24h price changes for top 5
- Calculate any interesting metrics

**Phase 4: Visualize** (2 min)
- Create a simple bar chart showing price changes
- Save as PNG

**Target time:** 10 minutes

## Success Criteria

✅ Loaded REAL data from CoinGecko API  
✅ Data successfully moved to S3 via Relay  
✅ Business question answered with numbers  
✅ Visualization created and saved  
✅ Workflow completed independently

## Technical Notes

**Relay API:** http://localhost:8001/api/v1  
**S3 Bucket:** airbyte-poc-bucket-cb (already configured)  
**Tools available:** Python, requests, pandas, matplotlib

**Hint:** Relay supports REST API sources! Check `/capabilities` to see the source type.

---

## Deliverables

1. **ANSWER.txt** - Clear answer with top crypto and price changes
2. **crypto_chart.png** - Bar chart of 24h changes
3. **Time breakdown** - How long each phase took
4. **Usability rating** - 1-10 with reasoning
5. **Feedback** - What worked? What didn't?

---

## Expected Results (Don't Peek!)

Bitcoin should be #1 by market cap (~$1-2 trillion)  
Ethereum usually #2 (~$300-500 billion)  
Price changes typically range from -5% to +5% in 24h

If your numbers are wildly different, double-check the data loaded correctly.

## Why This Test Matters

This proves Relay can handle:
- Real-world public APIs
- Live financial data
- No local test infrastructure needed
- Production-grade workflow
